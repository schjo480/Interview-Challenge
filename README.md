# Interview-Challenge
Logistic regression model for classification of hand gestures based on acceleration data in x, y, and z directions.
To run the jupyter notebook 'Gesture Classification.ipynb', please follow the next steps.

1. Install requirements.

To install all the necessary libraries, please run the following command:
'pip install -r requirements.txt'

2. If you download the uWave gesture data from here: http://zhen-wang.appspot.com/rice/files/uwave/uWaveGestureLibrary.zip, unzip the package first and then unzip all the .rar files using the Unarchiver for example.

If you just use the data that is contained in the .zip file I sent, there is no need to unzip the .rar files.

3. To run the notebook you have to set your working directory in the first cell. Please set the working directory to the folder that holds the 'uWaveGestureLibrary' folder.

4. Finally, run all cells.
